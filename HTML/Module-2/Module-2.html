Lesson 2.5


What is CSS?

CSS = Cascading Style Sheet
It is the language that apply style to the webpage. Can create size of pages and make it dynamic

There are 3 ways of adding CSS to the page:

1 - Inline, added directly in the tag element with attributes (not the best option)

  <p style="font-size: 48px;"  > </p>

2 - Internal, using the <style> tag, which is added to the HTML file.

  <style> 
    p {
      font-size: 48px;
    }

    div {
      font-size: 48px;
    }
  </style>


3 - External CSS, using an external file with the CSS code, which can be imported to any page. (best practice)
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/StyleCssFile.css" >
  Links the HTML page to the CSS file.
