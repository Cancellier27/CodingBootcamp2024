History of AWS: ---------------------------------------------
  2002 - launched internally i Amazon
  2003 - One the core ideas of Amazon for the market.
  2004 - Launches public with SQS
  2006 - Re-launched public with SQS, S3 and EC2
  2007 - Launched in Europe
    Dropbox, Netflix, Airbnb and NASA use AWS


Why do we need cloud computing?: ---------------------------------------------

  IP = internet protocol, unique number that identifies the device in the internet
  Network = Cables, routers and servers connected with each other
  Router = network device that forwards data packets between computer networks
  Switch = tales a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network
  
  datacenter = is a room or building dedicated to house computer systems and associated components.
    composed of three parts:
      1. Compute -> applications
      2. Storage -> shelf of drives to store the data generated by the applications
      3. Network -> routers, Switch to provide the connection

    Drawback of datacenter:
      Pay for the rent of the building  
      Pay for the power supply, cooling, maintenance
      Add the replace hardware every now and then
      Scaling is limited


What is cloud computing?: ---------------------------------------------

  is a on-demand delivery of computer power, database,storage, applications and other IT resources
  if pay as you go
  simple access to server
  AWS owns and maintain the network-connected hardware for these application to run, while you can just use it online.
  It basically takes away all the hardware issues from whoever wants to use the storage and they just use the web application.
  Netflix and Dropbox use AWS

How to use Cloud computing: ---------------------------------------------
  How to deploy:
    Private cloud (not included in AWS) - Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to public
                  - complete control
                  - Secure to sensitive applications  
                  - Private hardware separated for your applications

      Public Cloud - Cloud services used and operated by third parties providers.
      
      Hybrid Cloud - keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities on the cloud. Such as, computing on my own server and storage on AWS
                   - Can keep the sensitive data into your own database, and the rest to the public cloud.

Problems solved with Cloud: ---------------------------------------------
  Flexibility
  Cost effectiveness, pay as you go
  Scalability, to increase yor storage easily
  Elasticity, to scale up or down whenever needed.
  High-availability
  Agility

Types of Cloud computing: ---------------------------------------------
  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    Provide building blocks for cloudIT
    Provides networking, computers, data storage space
    Highest level of Flexibility
    Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
  
  Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    Remove the need for your org to manage the underlying Infrastructure
    Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
 
  Software as a Service (SaaS)
    Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

Pricing of the cloud: ---------------------------------------------
  Compute:
    Pay for the processing power consumed
  storage:
    Pay for the data stored
  Data transfer OUT of the cloud
    data transfer out, not in
