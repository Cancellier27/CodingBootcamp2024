IAM - Identity and Access Management, Global Service
  Part of AWS that defines the access for each member that will be working on the database. 

  Root account - created by default, and it should not be shared. It has full access.
  Users - People within organization and can be grouped together 
        - Users don't need to belong to any group, or can be part of one group or many groups.
  Groups - Contain only users and not other Groups
  Permissions - Polices assigned to JSON documents
              - Define the permissions of the users
              - In AWS you should give to each user the least privileges possible. Not more than needed

How to add new users: ------------------------------
  1. Go to IAM (Identity and Access Management)
  2. Select the "Users" on the left panel
  3. Click on "Create user" on the top left corner
  4. Create an username
  5. if it is a programmer and need access to terminal and coding, select the "AWS Management Console" and create and "IAM user"
  6. specify the password or not
  7. re-create the password on login, or not.
  8. "Next"
  9. Create a group and add policies pre-made or create your own. And if needed add the user to the groups.
  10. Review and create the user.

How to secure your database: -------------------------------
  Strong password = higher security for your account
    In AWS you can setup a password policy
      lower case
      Upper case
      special character
    Allow IAM users to change their  password
    password change every certain time
    prevent password re-use


  Multi factor authentication (MFA): 
    User have access to your acc and can possibly change config or delete
    MFA = Password you know + security device you own

    MFA can be virtual devices, like google app authentication. Or can be a hardware device that generates keys


How can user access AWS: ---------------------------------------------------------------
  To access AWS there are 3 options:
    AWS management Console
    AWS command Line interface
    AWS Software Developer Kit
  Access keys are generated through the AWS console


IAM roles: ------------------------------------------------
  Some AWS services will need to perform actions on your behalf
  To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM roles
    IAM roles is basically a virtual Machine (VM)

IAM security tools: ---------------------------------------
  IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
    A report that lists all your acc
  
  IAM access advisor (user-level)
    can see for  example the last time a user used a service.
    you can use this info to review your policies and access lists

IAM guidelines & best practices
  Do not use the root acc except AWC acc setup
  never share your acc
  Create a strong password
  use and enforce a MFA
  Create and use roles for giving permission to AWS
  Use access keys for programming access
  Audit permissions of your acc with the IAM Credentials Report or IAM AccessAdvisor
  Never share IAM users & access keys
