IAM - Identity and Access Management, Global Service
  Part of AWS that defines the access for each member that will be working on the database. 

  Root account - created by default, and it should not be shared. It has full access.
  Users - People within organization and can be grouped together 
        - Users don't need to belong to any group, or can be part of one group or many groups.
  Groups - Contain only users and not other Groups
  Permissions - Polices assigned to JSON documents
              - Define the permissions of the users
              - In AWS you should give to each user the least privileges possible. Not more than needed
