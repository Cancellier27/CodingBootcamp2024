EC2
  EC2 is one of the most popupar AWS' offering
  ECS = Elastic Compute Cloud = IaaS
  EC2 integrations:
    Renting virtual machine (EC2)
    Storing data on virtual drivers (EBS)
    Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    Scaling the services using an auto scaling group (ASG)

  **Knowing the EC2 is fundamental to know how the cloud works

EC2 configurations options:
  Operation system, Windows or Linux (no mac at the time of the course.)
  how much compute power (cores)
  How much random-access memory (RAM)
  how much storage  
    Network attached (EBS & EFS)
    hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
  Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
  Firewall rules: security group
  Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 - Instance creation ------------------------------------
  Create an instance of a virtual machine to host your apps, such as an web-app.
  go to EC2 service and select the "Instance" on the left panel, then click on the "Launch Instances" on the top right side.
  Then follow the steps on the page to create the instance. For free service use the "Free tier" options.

  Security Groups: =======================================
    If configures the rules for access to the EC2 instances.
    Security groups just have allow rules
    Security groups can reference by IP or by sectary group

    There is inbound traffic in the EC2 and outbound traffic.
    EC2 pre configures the outbound to allow any, so EC2 can access everything, but has no pre-set config for inbound
    so we need to decide what can access the EC2 instance. Such as Http, Https...

    Inbound
    ---------->    |             |
    Outbound       |EC2 Instance |
    <----------    |             |

    Security Groups act like a Firewall
    They allow: 
      Access to Ports
      Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
      Control of inbound and outbound

      Port for the trainings:
        22 - SSH (security shell linux)
        21 - FTP (file transfer protocol)
        22 - SFTP (Secure file transport protocol)
        80 - Http
        443 - HTTPS
        3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

    SSH security protocol, allows our Ec2 to be accessible by cmd
      it can be accessed through Putty (software that can be used to control Ec2), cmd and Ec2 instance connect

    To access SSH through cmd use the below command
      ssh -i AWS/EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@3.10.210.193
      If it does not work, the file .pem might need to have its access changed in windows

    EC2 instance connect 
      Connect to your EC2 instance within your browser
      no need to use the .pem file  
      
      Go to your EC2 instances, select the instance you want to edit, make sure the security group have ssh enabled. Click on the top rich
      corner button saying "connect" and select the tab EC2 Instance connect. It should open an cmd online with a temporary access key.
      

EC2 Instance Roles ---------------------------------------
  Never add your personal keys into the EC2 instances. 
  Because there might be more people connected and they can have your credentials and accesses
  Instead you can add policies created in the IAM service and this will configure your access 
   To do this, right click on the instance, or "Actions" button, "Security" and "Modify IAM role" 
   and there you can add you IAM role group with the policies you set up

EC2 Launch Types -----------------------------------------
  ON-demand: (staying in the hotel whenever like and pay full price)
    short workload, predictable pricing
    Pay for what you use 
      Linux - billing per minute after first minute 
      other OS pay per hour
    Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
    No long-term commitment (terminate the EC2, stops paying)
    (Recommended for short term and un-interrupted workload where you cannot predict how the application will behave)

  Reserved (min 1 year): (Plan ahead to book the rooms at the hotel and can get a good discount)
    Normal: 72% discount compared to On-demand  
      reservation-Period: 1 year or 3 years, the more years reserved, the more discount
      payment: No upfront payment, Partial and full payment. More discount to quicker payment.
      Reserved and specific instance Types, cannot change
      (Recommended for steady-state, usage)
    Convertible:
      Can change the EC2 instance type
      up to 45% discount
    Schedule:
      Launch within the window you reserve
      commitment of 1 year  
      (Recommended for whe you need extra computing, so you can Schedule to escalate your compute power.)

  Spot instances: (Guests bid for the free room, but can be kicked out at any time)
    Can get a discount of max 90% compared to on-demand
    might loose the instance if your price is goes up the stop price. In case you need more processing, so your price will go up
    therefore you can loose your instance when it reaches the max set up price set by you and someone else can take it over.
    (Recommended for jobs that are resilient to failure, image processing, distributed works, batch jobs,)
    (not suitable for critical jobs)

  EC2 Dedicated Server: (book the entire hotel building for yourself)
    host a physical server of EC2 instances fully dedicated to you. 
    You have access to the hardware
    3 Years reservation period.
    More expensive.
    Useful for software that have complicated licensing model

  EC2 Dedicated Instances: (book the entire hotel building for yourself)
    Host of EC2 instances fully dedicated to you. 
    You DO NOT have access to the hardware
    3 Years reservation period.
    More expensive.
    Useful for software that have complicated licensing model
  
Shared responsibility model for EC2 ---------------------
  AWS will:
    Infrastructure
    isolation on physical hosts
    replacing failure hardware
    compliance validation
  
  You will:
    Security groups
    OS and patches updates
    software installed in the EC2 instances 
    IAM roles assigned to the EC2 and IAM used access management
    Data security of your EC2 (encryption, password, etc...)
